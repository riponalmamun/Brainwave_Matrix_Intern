# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern

This is my first project (Task 1) from my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions , where I dived into the exciting realm of Machine Learning. Here's a breakdown of what accomplished.
 Title: Build a Fake News Detection Model using Machine Learning
 I gathered datasets from Kaggle comprising both real and fake news articles.This process laid the foundation for subsequent analysis. I split the dataset into training and testing subsets and proceeded to train a Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Model. The initial model demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.95% on the test set.
